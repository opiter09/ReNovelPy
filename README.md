# ReNovelPy
THIS DOESN'T WORK YET!!!

In the future, though, it will be a tool to turn Ren'Py Visual Novels into regular novels (i.e. Word documents). That way, you can print it out, and then when climate change destroys civilization these VNs won't all be lost to time.

Also, not that it matters yet, but please, please, PLEASE do not use this to facilitate piracy. It does NOT come with any assets, but a) it unpacks them all if they were archived, and b) you could spread the result around if you wanted. Always support the devs that make these incredible works!
